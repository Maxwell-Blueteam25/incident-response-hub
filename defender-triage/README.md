# 🛡️ Defender Triage

This folder contains real-world phishing investigations and incident triage work conducted using **Microsoft Defender XDR**. Each case follows a structured incident response process aligned with the **NIST 800-61** lifecycle, using **KQL**, email telemetry, and external reputation tools.

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques Used

- **Microsoft Defender Email & Collaboration** – Alert triage and mailbox scoping
- **KQL Queries** – Hunting across `EmailEvents`, `UrlClickEvents`, `EmailUrlInfo`, `SigninLogs`
- **Microsoft Header Analyzer** – Parsing and mapping message routing behavior
- **OSINT Sources** – VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, WHOIS for IP and domain reputation
- **Sandbox Testing** – Manual URL interaction in safe environments to observe behavior
- **Compliance Actions** – Blocking IPs/domains, purging messages, user follow-up

## 📁 Case Studies in This Folder

### `phishing-dolese-cam.md`
- **Summary**: Investigated phishing message impersonating an invoice from a `.cam` domain
- **Key Indicators**:
  - IP flagged in VirusTotal/AbuseIPDB
  - Domain used urgency and deception
  - URL masqueraded as OneDrive, redirected to credential harvesting login page
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Full header analysis, IP/domain block, KQL triage to confirm single-user exposure
  - Sandbox tested phishing flow and documented infrastructure
- **NIST Phase Alignment**:
  - Detection, Analysis, Containment, Lessons Learned

## 🔍 NIST Lifecycle in Action

All investigations here follow:

1. **Detection & Analysis**  
   - Identify sender, content, routing, reputation  
   - Scope email and URL reach using KQL  
   - Confirm threat using sandbox and OSINT  

2. **Containment & Recovery**  
   - Block IOC artifacts (IPs, domains, URLs)  
   - Purge email from inboxes  
   - Validate user exposure and reset accounts if needed  

3. **Post-Incident**  
   - Reflect on detection gaps, update rules, and improve awareness  
   - Feed new indicators back into Defender policies
