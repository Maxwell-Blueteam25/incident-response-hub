# 🔵 BlueTeamLabs

Welcome to the `BlueTeamLabs` folder within my **IncidentResponseHub** — a dedicated repository where I document my hands-on learning, threat detection techniques, and incident response workflows.

This space showcases my experience in:
- 🔍 Log analysis (Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, EVTX)
- 🛡️ Threat detection with DeepBlueCLI, Sigma, and PowerShell
- 📊 SOC alert triage and investigation
- 🧠 MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping
- 📁 Case writeups from real-world simulated breaches
