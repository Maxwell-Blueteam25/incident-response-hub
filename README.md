# 🛡️ Maxwell Skinner's Incident Response Hub

Welcome to my **Incident Response Hub** — a curated collection of real-world phishing investigations, Microsoft Defender triage work, custom hunting queries, and NIST-aligned playbooks. This repository documents my approach to structured incident response during my cybersecurity internship and ongoing blue team development.

## 🔍 What This Repo Covers

This repo is organized around real incident response cases and investigation frameworks I've built and refined using:

- Microsoft Defender XDR
- KQL (Kusto Query Language)
- OSINT tools (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, WHOIS)
- Secure sandbox analysis
- Microsoft 365 Email & Collaboration Portal

Each branch or folder focuses on a specific toolset, investigation type, or phase in the NIST 800-61 incident response lifecycle.
